> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> This project is in early development by a sole developer. Expect bugs, missing features, and frequent changes.  
> **Data Loss Risk:** Non-backwards compatible database changes may result in loss of metadata, such as book titles, authors, and reading progress. Your actual book files (PDFs and ePubs) are unlikely to be affected, but it's always a good idea to keep a backup of both your database and your book files.  
> **Limited Support:** As this is a one-person project, support may be slow, and features could be experimental or incomplete. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
